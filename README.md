Making this from frontend Mentor for practice
<<<<<<< HEAD

I wanna send the input into server.... but I need more practice.
I can send it when they input something but the validation don't work.
I'm missing something because express can't read the jQuery... 

soooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
I just have everything in one html

the only files use in this project is
index.html
style.css
main.js

the rest are just extras for me to try out server stuff
I might come back to this when i learn more about server stuff
=======
still working on it
